- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sparkomatic
- 👀 I’m interested in advanced UX prototyping
- 🌱 I’m currently using Framer, a design tool, that allows me to design components in a GUI and then export them as ES Modules to load 
into React projects for making advanced prototypes based on logic and live data.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Smart TV and Games Console interface prototypes
- 📫 How to reach me: jasonpaulsparks@gmail.com
